**Develop Muliti-stage Physical Constraint Framework Applied in Constitutive Models** | Shantou University, China
*Third Author, Mentor: Zhen Wang* | Jul 2024 - Sep 2025

- To address the problem of insufficient physical consistency in data-driven constitutive models, a multi-stage physical-constraint learning framework was constructed to study the embedding strategies of physical priors and their effects.
- Baseline models (e.g., MLP, RNN, and PINN) and a unified experimental environment were built and implemented for method comparison and ablation analysis.
- An evaluation dataset and experimental protocol were constructed based on material mechanics-related properties, and evaluation was conducted from the perspectives of performance, stability, and physical consistency.
- The first and second laws of thermodynamics were incorporated into training in the forms of data constraints and network structural constraints, respectively; a stage-wise physical-constraint mechanism was designed and its effects were verified.
- Responsible for writing the Method and Experiments sections of the paper, and completed key experimental design, result analysis, figure preparation, and reference organization.
- Responsible for periodic academic presentations, presenting the method design and experimental conclusions.

**Models Communication** | Shantou University, China
*Leader, Mentor: Zhen Wang* | Nov 2025 - Present

- For multi-model collaborative learning, designed an inter-model communication protocol to explore information interaction mechanisms during training/inference.
- Implemented and validated the communication protocol in constitutive thermodynamics tasks; results showed that, under specific settings, smaller-parameter models can obtain performance/efficiency gains superior to complex models through communication-based collaboration.
- Leading the extension of the communication mechanism to medical ultrasound image segmentation tasks and verifying its cross-domain applicability.
- Guiding group members in conducting application experiments of the communication protocol on different tasks.
- Participating in paper writing and result organization.

**Multi-level Context-aware Reasoning and Multimodality for Visual Emotion Analysis** | Shantou University, China
*First Author, Mentor: Rui Li* | Apr 2025 - Jan 2026

- For problems in VEA tasks such as dispersed emotional cues and insufficient cross-modal semantic alignment, studied multi-level context-aware reasoning and multimodal fusion methods.
- Compared the performance of multiple text-image fusion strategies on VEA tasks and proposed improvement schemes based on experimental results.
- Collected and organized commonly used VEA datasets, and completed analyses of data distribution, data volume bias, and dataset characteristics to support model design and experimental settings.
- Investigated representative baseline models and constructed a unified comparison benchmark to ensure comparability and reproducibility of subsequent validation.
- Studied the role of the text modality in VEA, constructed a textualized expression framework for image emotion by integrating knowledge from affective science/psychology, and improved emotion representation capability through multimodal modeling, achieving SOTA on multiple datasets.
- Responsible for paper writing, experimental result visualization, and figure plotting.

**Medical Ultrasound Segmentation Model and AI Agent** | Shantou University, China
*Group Leader, Course Project, Basic Software Design Course* | Sep 2025 - Dec 2025

- Participated in building an integrated medical ultrasound segmentation model + AI Agent system for segmentation and result analysis.
- Investigated AI Agent frameworks and medical image segmentation models, completed technical selection, and set up the training environment and experimental pipeline.
- Collected and preprocessed ultrasound datasets, adapted segmentation models to task requirements, and completed model service encapsulation and front-end integration for AI Agent invocation.

**Deep Learning Summer Programme** | Cambridge, UK
*Mentor: Pietro Lio* | Jul 21, 2025 - Aug 3, 2026

- Studied the full architecture of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and delved into Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms, including DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) and MADDPG (Multi-Agent DDPG).
- Collaborated with a team of 11 members to develop a "Simple World Communicate Game" as the main project.
- Took responsibility for explaining the key algorithms (DDPG and MADDPG) used in the game, presenting their application and implementation to the team. And finally got 70% grape of this program.
